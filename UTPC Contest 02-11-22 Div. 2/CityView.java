Problem Statement : 
We have a camera lens and a set of n points on the grid . We need to find the minimum angle such that all the n points can fit in the line of sight of the lens .

Current Approach :
If we find the angles of all the n points and then find the minimum and maximum angle , we can take the difference of these angles to get the required minimum angle of the Lens
to capture all the n points

Failure :
Getting a failure on codeforces "Wrong answer on test 5" . 

Possible Areas of failure and steps taken to rectify them :
1. Algorithm seems right to me  - Joined discord to verify
2. Maybe it is the output format expectation as given in the question : "The answer will be considered valid if the relative or absolute error doesn't exceed 10âˆ’6" - Have
used BigDecimal with precision but with not much luck . Have also used String.format but no luck
3. Overflow or Underflow in operations like "angle+=360.0d" or "max-min" - Have tried to used BigDecimal again here but not much difference

Currently i am trying to create the failing test case 5. Maybe need some help. Do not want the solution.
